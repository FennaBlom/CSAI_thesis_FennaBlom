# CSAI_thesis_FennaBlom-classification-explanation

This repository contains the code for my master thesis. This code covers the topic classification and explainable AI part of the study. 

The repository does not include the trained models as they were too big to upload. These models, however, are available upon request.

The code for the conversational agent can be found here: https://github.com/FennaBlom/CSAI_thesis_FennaBlom-rasa
